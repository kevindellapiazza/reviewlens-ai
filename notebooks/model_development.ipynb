    "# ReviewLens AI: Model Development and Validation\n",

    "**Author:** Kevin Della Piazza\n",
    "**Date:** October 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook documents the development and validation process for the core AI models of the ReviewLens platform. The objective is to test a suite of four distinct NLP models on a sample of the dataset to validate their effectiveness and to prototype the foundational Python code for the production AWS Lambda functions. This notebook serves as a professional artifact detailing the data science workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Models Tested:\n",
    "1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** For overall positive/negative classification.\n",
    "2.  **Zero-Shot Classification:** For dynamic topic tagging.\n",
    "3.  **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA):** For fine-grained sentiment on specific features.\n",
    "4.  **Topic Modeling:** For discovering latent themes in the text corpus."
